            <h1>Tels.com's Corporate Mission Statement</h1>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Tels' mission statement is “We strive to offer our customers the lowest possible prices, the best available selection, <br>
                and the utmost convenience.”<br>
                 This corporate mission promises attractive e-commerce services to satisfy target customers' needs. <br>
                 The company focuses on the variables of price, selection, and convenience.<br>
                  In this regard, the following characteristics are identifiable in Tels' corporate mission statement:<br><br>

            1.Lowest prices.<br>
            2.Best selection.<br>
            3.Utmost convenience.<br><br>
            The “lowest prices” component of the mission statement guides the pricing strategies included in Tels.com Inc.'s marketing mix or 4P. <br>
            Low prices are a selling point that makes the company's e-commerce website and services attractive.<br>
            A corresponding strategic objective is to reduce operational costs to enable the business to minimize prices. <br>
            Tels' corporate mission statement also points to having the best selection. For example, the wide array of products on the company's <br>
            website is a factor that attracts customers. Moreover, Tels.com Inc.'s corporate mission emphasizes convenience, <br>
            such as in accessing the company's products via the Internet. <br>
            This characteristic is a response to consumers' use of “convenience” as a criterion <br>
            when evaluating the quality and attractiveness of online retail services.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h2>Tels.com's Corporate Vision and Corporate Mission - Recommendations</h2>
                Tels.com's mission statement satisfies many of the conventional characteristics of ideal mission statements.<br>
                 For example, the company includes target customers and market, variety of products, <br>
                 and basic business aims (pricing and convenience) in the corporate mission.<br>
                 However, the company does not include technology and the nature of the business and its operations. <br>
                 In this regard, it is recommended that Amazon add details in its corporate mission to give employees <br>
                 and investors a better idea of what the company is all about. This recommendation should make the corporate <br>
                 mission statement more comprehensive, especially in representing the company's businesses, such as e-commerce,<br>
                  cloud-based computing services, digital content delivery, software and hardware, and brick-and-mortar retail (Tels Books).<br>
                
                Tels.com's vision statement possesses strong characteristics, such as the specification of the company's <br>
                target market and an aspect of its marketing mix. However, this corporate vision satisfies only some of the <br>
                conventional characteristics of ideal vision statements. For example, Tels' corporate vision is concise, clear,<br>
                 and abstract enough to ensure suitability in various areas of the business. Still, this corporate vision is not <br>
                 stable enough to ensure its suitability in the future of the business. For instance, Tels' business now includes <br>
                 cloud services and brick-and-mortar bookstores. Yet, the company's vision statement still focuses on e-commerce. <br>
                 Thus, it is recommended that Tels improve its corporate vision statement by adding these details about such businesses <br>
                 to make the statement comprehensive in reflecting the future state of the corporation.
